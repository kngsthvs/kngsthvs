<p align="center">
As the Father hath loved me,
<br>
so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.
<br>
<br>
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love;
<br>
even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
<br>
<br>
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.
<br>
<br>
This is my commandment,
<br>
That ye love one another, as I have loved you.
<br>
<br>
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
<br>
<br>
Ye are my friends,
<br>
if ye do whatsoever I command you.
<br>
<br>
Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends;
<br>
for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
<br>
<br>
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
<br>
that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain:
<br>
that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
<br>
<br>
These things I command you, that ye love one another.
<br>
